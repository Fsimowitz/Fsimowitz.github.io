		<p class="blocktext">
			I am an intensely curious and motivated individual. I am so excited to be attending Startup institute's Summer 2014 technical marketing track. My goal is to become a dynamic and data-driven marketer focused on content creation. I graduated from Westminster Choir College with a degree in music education. I am passionate about education and changing the traditional paradigms of the classroom. The tech industry in many ways is making great moves to make education better and more accessible to people of all ages and interests. Startups are changing the world, and I want to be a part of it!
